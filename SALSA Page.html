	<p>
		In Central Virginia there are several libraries that have joined a consortium to offer resources to the local area through a sharing of their resources between libraries. They have entitled this consortium as Southside Area Libraries Sharing Access or SALSA. The current member libraries are the <a href="https://cvrl.net/">Central Virginia Regional Library</a> which includes three public libraries from the Town of Farmville/Prince Edward County, Buckingham Public Library and Cumberland Public Library, <a href="https://libguides.longwood.edu/home/about">Greenwood Library from Longwood University </a>  and the <a href="https://libguides.hsc.edu/about">Walter M. Bortz, III Library from Hampden-Sydney College</a>. The SALSA consortium was created in 2021 between the Central Virginia Regional Library and Hampden-Sydney College as a way to share resources and to be able to offer more access to patrons throughout the area in which they are located. Longwood University joined the consortium in 2022, expanding the access even further. 
	</p>	

	<h2 style="color:083D77;">Users</h2>
	<p>
		Patrons of any of the libraries are able to request documents and items from other libraries within the SALSA consortium and it will be delivered to their “home” library. For example, if a patron’s home library is the Cumberland Public Library, he/she can request a book or DVD from the Hampden-Sydney College library and it would be delivered to the Cumberland library on the weekly shuttle service. It is not considered an interlibrary loan but just a regular checkout because all the libraries’ systems are connected so when you search one you receive items from all the locations. 
	</p>
	<p>
		SALSA has opened access for many people in a rural area that would not normally have access to two college/university libraries. It also offers the college students the opportunity to access the local library collections. So a patron from the Buckingham public library, who would normally have access to 70,755 items within the Central Virginia Regional Library, now has access to those along with the 291,353 items at the Greenwood Library along with the 273,787 items at the Bortz Library, significantly expanding their access to information. 
	</p>
	<p>
		The libraries in the SALSA consortium all have migrated their systems to Symphony by SirsiDynix so that their catalogs can be searched between the libraries. This was no small undertaking with the size of the libraries but well worth the effort. It also means that when new items are added to the system of one of the systems they have to follow very strict cataloguing guidelines to ensure that the records all line up. 
	</p>
	<p>
		This system is very unique in that it is in a rather rural area of Central Virginia, with Farmville being the largest town in several counties. Many patrons of the smaller libraries are students who attend college online somewhere and still need access to an academic library, something that if they are not a student at Longwood or Hampden-Sydney they may not have easy access to if not for the SALSA consortium. It is also unique in that it is a combined effort of public and academic libraries to create more accessible information for a community.

	<h2 style="color:083D77;">Pros and Cons</h2>	

	<p>
	One of the cons of the system is that a patron has to be willing to wait for items to be delivered as the shuttle between libraries only runs one day a week. Another con is that a patron doesn’t necessarily have access to the online databases at Longwood or Hampden-Sydney which means the patron may have to request an ILL through their public library for an item. They do have access to going to the physical library and doing their searches in person but that can be an impediment if they do not drive or are farther out in one of the more rural areas surrounding the counties covered by the SALSA consortium. 
	</p>
	<p>
A pro to SALSA is that it does open up the availability of several thousand items that the public libraries may not have access to otherwise. It also opens up the doors of the academic libraries for members of the public libraries to be able to study and access their information in person. 
	</p>

	<h2 style="color:083D77;">Conclusions and Suggestions</h2>
	<p>
	The only real suggestion I can think of for an improvement is to be able to open up access to the online databases to be able to be used by the public library users, but I think that is probably more of a money issue than an access issue. Adding access for what is like many thousands of patrons would likely up the prices of the databases for the schools and I do not foresee them wanting to take on that burden.
